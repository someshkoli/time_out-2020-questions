# time_out-2020-questions

Timeout is a 5 hrs competitive coding event held by CSI RAIT. The repo contains all the questions and their solutions with the used test cases.The test cases were generated with custom python scripts which can also be found in the directory. the output was also generated using custom python script which is also present.

I have generated 18 test cases for all the questions bt this can be changed bt altering it from the test generator as per required.
